Description:
TaskPro is our final course team project, where we've developed a comprehensive web application.

For the backend, we chose to work with Node.js environment. MongoDB serves as our primary database, with Mongoose facilitating seamless interaction with it. Routing is managed efficiently using the Express framework. Notably, we've integrated Cloudinary for storing user profile pictures, offering a seamless experience. Furthermore, email communication functionalities are enabled through Nodemailer, leveraging a dedicated account for this project.
